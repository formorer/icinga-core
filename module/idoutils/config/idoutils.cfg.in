# ICINGA CONFIG FOR IDOUTILS
#
# In order to have Icinga run the IDOMOD event broker module, you'll need
# to place a file like this into modules/ by default, and include that
# directory in your icinga.cfg
#
# Note: The sample bewlow remains commented, in order not to harm
# existing setups. make install-idoutils will override this file!

#define module{
#        module_name     idomod
#        module_type     neb
#        path            @bindir@/idomod.o
#        args            config_file=@sysconfdir@/idomod.cfg
